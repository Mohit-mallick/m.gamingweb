# MO Gaming Website - HTML & CSS Practice

This project is a basic gaming website created using HTML and CSS. It was designed as a practice exercise to improve and solidify my CSS skills. By closely replicating this website, you'll gain hands-on experience with CSS, helping you to better understand styling techniques and layout management. Though simple, this project serves as an excellent learning tool for anyone looking to enhance their front-end development abilities.
